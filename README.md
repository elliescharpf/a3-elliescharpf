## Your Web Application Title

https://a3-elliescharpf.vercel.app/

## Goal
The goal of the application is to login using 1 of the 2 users: username: testuser1, password: 123, or username: testuser2, password: 1234.
Then you are redirected to the spending tracker where you can add transactions where they will be displayed in the transaction data table. If you were to logout (by going to the login page and clicking log out) and then log back in, your data will still be there (after you click add transaction, the previous data is displayed).
There are also edit and delete buttons for each transaction where you can edit the amount, or delete that specific transaction.

## Challenges
- I faced a lot of challenges in this assignment and some of them include: trying to make a register button, but I could not figure out how to put the data into mongodb compass.
- Connecting the user data from mongodb compass to its own transaction data.
- Having the data show up for the specific user without having to click add transaction (I still haven't figured this out yet).
- I also have error messages in the console about tailwindcss that I have not resolved

## Authentication
I chose to use local storage for authentication because it was the easiest and most straight forward. 

## Framework
I used tailwindCSS because this is the framework my group chose for our final project so I wanted to get some idea of how to use it. I kept my original background and also made the edit and delete buttons orange and red because I thought it looked better. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I made a clear transaction button which clears the users transactions all at once. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I deployed my site on Vercel instead of Glitch.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I used the tailwindcss framework but I also implemented my own design choices including the gradient background and the edit and delete buttons.
